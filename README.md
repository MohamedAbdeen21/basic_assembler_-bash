# Description

This is an assembler written for the basic computer proposed by Morris Mano in his Computer Systems Architecture textbook. The asssembler is written in bash.
This is the bash version of the assembler I built using SQL that can be found [here](https://github.com/MohamedAbdeen21/basic_assembler_SQL).
